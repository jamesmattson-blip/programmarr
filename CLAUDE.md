This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working with this repository.

## What This Is

A Python 3 CLI pipeline that exports a Plex library, feeds it to an LLM for channel curation, and creates themed virtual TV channels in [Tunarr](https://github.com/chrisbenincasa/tunarr).

## Workflow

```
export.py  →  LLM (Gemini/Claude/ChatGPT)  →  create.py
               or
export.py  →  generate_no_ai.py  →  create.py
```

## Running the Scripts

```powershell
# Step 1 — export Plex library to CSV
python export.py

# Step 2a — AI path: paste plex_library.csv + PROMPT.md into any LLM, save output as channels.json
# Step 2b — no-AI path: auto-generate starter channels.json from metadata
python generate_no_ai.py

# Step 3 — create channels in Tunarr
python create.py --probe    # dry run first
python create.py            # apply
```

## Configuration

All config lives in `config.json` (gitignored — never hardcode credentials):

```json
{
    "tunarr_url": "http://your-tunarr:8000",
    "plex_url":   "http://your-plex:32400",
    "plex_token": "your-token"
}
```

See `config.json.example` for the template.

## Architecture

**`export.py`**
- Fetches full metadata directly from Plex API (`/library/sections/{key}/all`)
- Fields: title, year, contentRating, genres, directors, season/episode counts
- Cross-references against Tunarr to flag unsynced content
- Output: `plex_library.csv`

**`generate_no_ai.py`** (Option B — no AI required)
- Reads `plex_library.csv`
- Auto-generates decade channels (year filtering) and genre channels (genre tag matching)
- Auto-generates TV marathon channels for shows with 50+ episodes
- Writes placeholder entries for franchise/themed channels (user fills manually)
- Output: `channels.json`

**`create.py`**
- Reads `channels.json`
- Indexes Tunarr library (exact title matching, case-insensitive)
- Deletes all existing channels, creates new ones
- Builds Tunarr random-schedule payloads (30-day rolling window — channels loop forever, no dead air)
- Output: channels live in Tunarr

## Channel Numbering Scheme

| Block  | Range | Content |
|--------|-------|---------|
| TV Marathons | 10–19 | 24/7 single-show loops (50+ episodes) |
| TV Blocks    | 20–29 | Themed multi-show rotations |
| Movies       | 30–49 | Genre and decade channels |
| Franchise    | 50–69 | Ordered series (MCU, Batman, etc.) |
| Specialty    | 70–79 | Single-movie loops, holiday, niche |

## channels.json Schema

```json
{
  "channels": [
    {
      "number": 10,
      "name": "Channel Name",
      "shuffle": "ordered",
      "content": ["Exact Title From Plex"]
    }
  ],
  "orphaned": [],
  "suggested_channels": []
}
```

**shuffle values:** `ordered` | `shuffle` | `block`

Content titles must match Plex library names exactly (case-insensitive).
A title can appear on multiple channels — this is intentional and expected.

## Tunarr API Endpoints Used

- `GET /api/media-sources` — discover Plex source and library IDs
- `GET /api/media-libraries/{id}/programs` — all episodes/movies in a library
- `GET /api/transcode_configs` — fetch transcode config ID at runtime
- `GET /api/channels` — list existing channels
- `POST /api/channels` — create channel
- `DELETE /api/channels/{id}` — delete channel
- `POST /api/channels/{id}/programming` — set rolling schedule (body: `{"type":"random","programs":[...],"schedule":{...}}`; schedule requires `padStyle` and `randomDistribution` as of current Tunarr version)

## Plex API Endpoints Used

- `GET /library/sections` — discover library section keys
- `GET /library/sections/{key}/all?type=1` — all movies with full metadata
- `GET /library/sections/{key}/all?type=2` — all TV shows with full metadata

No dependencies beyond the Python standard library.

## Git Workflow

- Commit messages must be verbose and descriptive — explain what changed and why, not just "fix bug" or "update script".
- Update this file (CLAUDE.md) whenever a feature changes: new flags, API behavior changes, schema updates, new scripts, or removed functionality.
- After any feature change: update CLAUDE.md, commit with a detailed message, and push to origin.
